## About Oblique Strategies

Created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, Oblique Strategies are a deck of cards meant to help artists overcome creative blocks. Each card contains a phrase or cryptic remark that can be used to break deadlocks or dilemmas in a creative situation.

This app contains all the original strategies and integrates them intelligently into conversational AI assistance specifically focused on music creation.
